| Handmade Lite is an educational game engine, written by Karsten Vermeulen for the purposes of |
| educating other fellow programmers, programming students and anyone else wishing to learn     |
| about game development, C++ and OOP. The engine, class design and overall structure is by no  |
| means perfect and there is certainly room for improvement. Feel free to use, copy, break,     |
| update and do as you wish with this code - it is there, free, for all!                        |
|																							    |
| Designed to teach. Made from scratch. Built by hand.							                |
